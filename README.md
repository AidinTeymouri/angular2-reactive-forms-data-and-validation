This is the repository for my course, [Angular 2 Forms: Data Binding and Validation](https://www.lynda.com/AngularJS-tutorials/Angular-2-Forms-Data-Binding-Validation/461451-2.html). 
The full course is available at [lynda.com](https://lynda.com).  

## Course Description

Building HTML forms in the web world is never as straightforward as expected. Collecting user input and implementing dynamic form validation, 
that automatically reacts to input, can be difficult without the right solution. When building client side apps using Angular you get a good 
amount of framework code out of the box that makes working with forms a breeze. Angular allows you to easily handle dynamic form validation 
by taking advantage of two-way data-binding functionality.  

This course shows how to build HTML web forms with the Angular forms module, using Angular form building blocks and built-in validation 
properties and methods. Learn how to use the model-driven forms approach to build out a model representation of form data in code and 
bind it to native HTML form elements. This course also explores how to implement validation, using JavaScript, in case you need more 
fine tuned control of your interactions.
